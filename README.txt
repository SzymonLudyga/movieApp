    1. Type movie title and click 'Add movie to database'
    2. Adding comments is available after choosing one of the movie, it becomes visible along with movie details
    3. After adding few movies and comments click 'Go to comment section'
    4. In comment section, type movie ID to filter all comments to that movie
